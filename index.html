        <p class="parrafoText">
          The Latinx Leaders Roundtable formed to produce the Greater Rochester
          Latinx Agenda during the pandemic. The 2021 Latinx Agenda intends to
          be the starting place to initiate dialogue, create focus, and develop
          advocacy strategies relevant to our community. This is a living
          document and will be updated on a consistent basis. The LLR recognizes
          that there are other important matters that did not make the final
          document and we will continue to work with the community to evolve our
          agenda. We welcome your support, advocacy, and partnership to advance
          our work. This will not be a shelf plan. If there are pieces of the
          agenda you wish to champion, we encourage you to reach out in
          partnership. Authentic engagement of the Latinx community will be
          critically important as context is just as important as the content of
          this agenda. We look forward to bringing progress to life.
